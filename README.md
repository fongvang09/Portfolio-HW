# Portfolio-HW

My portfolio contains random pictures of me as well as a quick bio about myself. The most updated portfolio provides even more pictures and also a paragraph about what I've been doing. There is a contacts page, a portfolio page which mainly has images and lastly an 'about me' page.

## Purpose of a portfolio

The purpose of a portfolio is to show future employers whatever I want them to see but mainly to see how functional the webpage is and how capable you are. It also briefly tells the employer more about who you are as an individual, what you did, what your goals are, and what skills you can offer to them.

## Future development

Probably implement more of what I learned recently such as Javascript, jQuery and more stuff that we haven't tackled yet and add it to the page just to add more value to the page.
