              <div class="col-sm-8" class="col-md-8" class="col-lg-9">Hello! Allow me to briefly introduce myself! My name is Fong Vang. I currently reside in Minneapolis. I enjoy eating food. What type of food you might ask? Well, I'm not much of a picky eater but I do love eating noodles with sriracha sauce for an added flavor, pizza, pho (a vietnamese noodle-base bowl) and steak to name a few. 
                <p>I enjoy playing games that are competitive whether that's on the PC or just any outdoor sports. As of now, I'm looking towards a new career within the programmer/developer field. Prior to picking up on coding, I worked at a steel mill right outside of St. Paul. Unfortunately, the mill went through a mass layoff due lack of demand but when one door closes, another one opens. Many of the more experienced workers there with decades of experience were laid off.
                To be forced to go out of your comfort zone and search for another job just before retirement is scary and somewhat of a setback. I digress but with that in mind, I have decided to continue my education and look where the future is. I want to keep improving on myself so I that won't have any regrets in the future thinking what I could have done differently. I look forward to completing the UofM coding bootcamp and honing my skills so that I may get back on track. Thank you for your time! </div>
<!-- Can't seem to figure this one out. Been playing with this for awhile now and still no solutions. Tried referencing back to the related activities and bootstrap but nothing. Attempted many times to change 'col-md' && 'col-lg' but it only expands the image...ding me some loss points but at least give me a hint on how to fix it? Would highly appreciate. Thanks. -->

          <p>Please feel free to contact me for anything! I look forward to speaking with you!</p>
