          <p>Hello! Allow me to briefly introduce myself! My name is Fong Vang. I currently reside in Minneapolis. I
            enjoy eating food. What type of food you might ask? Well, I'm not much of a picky eater but I do love eating
            noodles with sriracha sauce for an added flavor, pizza, pho (a vietnamese noodle-base bowl) and steak to
            name a few.
            I enjoy playing games that are competitive whether that's on the PC or just any outdoor sports. As of now,
            I'm looking towards a new career within the programmer/developer field.
            Prior to picking up on coding, I worked at a steel mill right outside of St. Paul. Unfortunately, the mill
            went through a mass layoff due lack of demand but when one door closes, another one opens. Many of the more
            experienced workers there with decades of experience were laid off.
            To be forced to go out of your comfort zone and search for another job just before retirement is scary and
            somewhat of a setback. I digress but with that in mind, I have decided to continue my education and look
            where the future is.
            I want to keep improving on myself so I that won't have any regrets in the future thinking what I could have
            done differently. I look forward to completing the UofM coding bootcamp and honing my skills so that I may
            get back on track. Thank you for your time!
            Please feel free to contact me for anything! I look forward to speaking with you!</p>

      <h2>Updated Portfolio</h2>
      <p>It's already been a little over a month into this course and I've learned so much already. During that time, I
        learned how to create a timed-quiz which was fun. It allowed
        me to be a little bit more creative with my questions and answers. I ended up doing one that allowed the player
        to select one of the four pictures and compare which one was
        different. Another fun assignment that I liked was our first group project. It allowed us to build whatever
        website/app we wanted to using API keys and then polishing it to our
        liking. My group and I decided to make a movie website that uses search engine optimization (SEO) to find the
        user's search results and then it'll display the results. They can
        then follow the links directing them to where the movie is listed at and watch it from there. We also decided to
        add a little feature where any users can just watch a list of
        free movies towards the bottom of the page. Below is the following link:

      <p>Aside from hours of learning coding inside and outside of class, it's also important to take a break once in
        awhile to give your brain a chance to store in all the data.
        During my free time around this time of year, I like to go ice fishing only if my homework allows me to. It's
        pretty much the only time I get to spend time with nature nowadays
        as well as hanging out with the brothers.

        Hello! The few following pictures in the following order left to right, top to bottom were from a few years
        ago. Very briefly, <span style="font-weight: bold;">(1)</span>first photo consists of me and
        a few of my good friends that we met from high school. This picture was taken at Chicago's Willis Tower
        observation deck. <span style="font-weight: bold;">(2)</span>Second photo is just my friends
        posing for fun as if they were in a business setting. This picture was taken at a hotel at Bangkok, Thailand.
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">(3)</span>A temple that is inaccessible in the middle of a large pond
        in Thailand. <span style="font-weight: bold;">(4)</span>A luxurious watch that I took a photo of from an
        expensive store somewhere in Thailand. <span style="font-weight: bold;">(5)</span>A few of my friends and I
        wanted to experience a new
        way of eating so we went into a restaurant inside a mall in Thailand called MBK Center. All you can eat
        hotpot-style while sitting next to the conveyor of food on a plate
        prepped by chefs at the back. <span style="font-weight: bold;">(6)</span>Fishing is a part of me so here I am
        posing with some walleyes that I caught at St. Cloud awhile back!
